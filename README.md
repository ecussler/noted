  ## Description
  Noted is a note taking app using Express.js that allows the user to add new notes, view old ones, and  delete notes. This app:

  - Integrates the front and back end using the server.js
  - Shows usage of fetch, get and delete calls to the database
  - Properly logs unique ids to each note when saved

  As my first project using a server, I was surprised that I was able to successfully complete the project (albeit with a few headaches). While I'm sure real-world servers are infinitely more complicated, this app was a nice introduction to the back-end world of servers.
